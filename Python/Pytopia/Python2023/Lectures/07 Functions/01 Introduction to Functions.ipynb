However, the functions we use in programming go beyond the simple input-output mapping you might have encountered in math class.\n"

Similarly, in programming, a function can take inputs (known as parameters), perform operations, and return an output. But that's just the beginning. Programming functions can do infinitely moreâ€”they can execute complex blocks of code, handle various tasks, and create abstractions that make software development more modular and error-free.\n"

Similarly, a factory is a function that takes raw materials as input, performs various operations (cutting, shaping, assembling, etc.), and produces finished products as output.
