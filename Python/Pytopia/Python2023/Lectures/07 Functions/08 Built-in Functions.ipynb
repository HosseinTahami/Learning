For example, `sorted()` is efficient for sorting, while `min()` and `max()` are efficient for finding the smallest and largest items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Leverage Lazy Evaluation**: Functions like `map()` and `filter()` return iterators, which are lazily evaluated. This means that data is processed on-the-fly as you iterate, which can save memory when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beware of Unnecessary Copies**: Some functions return new objects, which can be inefficient if the original object is large. For instance, `sorted()` returns a new list, unlike the `.sort()` method which sorts a list in place.\n",

    "- **Use Built-in Functions to Simplify Code**: Many built-in functions can replace more complex loops and conditional logic, leading to more concise and readable code. For example, using `any()` or `all()` can often make code easier to understand than a complex series of `if` statements.\n",
