A zero means the connection failed, and any non-zero number represents a successful connection. Use a `for` loop inside a `while` loop to iterate through the connection attempts. If a connection is successful (`non-zero`), print \"Connected\" and use the `break` statement to exit both loops. If all connection attempts fail after iterating through the whole list, print \"All connection attempts failed. Retrying...\" and start the connection attempts again.
