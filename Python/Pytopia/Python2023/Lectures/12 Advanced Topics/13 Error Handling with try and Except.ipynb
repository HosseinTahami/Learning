    "In Python, an exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program. It's Python's way of signaling that an error has occurred. When an exception is raised, if not properly handled, the program will terminate with an error message. This is often undesirable, especially for applications that require high availability or that interact with users. Instead, Python provides a way to catch these exceptions and respond to them without exiting the program.\n"

The `try` block contains the code that may cause an exception, while the `except` block contains the code that runs if an exception occurs. We can also use the `else` and `finally` blocks to define actions that should be taken depending on whether exceptions were raised or not.\n"
