However, the key characteristic that distinguishes a `frozenset` from a `set` is immutability. Once created, the elements within a `frozenset` cannot be changed, added, or removed. This immutability gives `frozenset` its unique properties and suitability for different scenarios compared to the mutable `set`.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Hashability**: Because it is immutable, a `frozenset` can be used as a key in a dictionary or as an element in another set, which is not possible with a regular `set`. You will learn more about hashability in advanced topics.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Dictionary keys: When you want to use a set as a dictionary key, you must use a `frozenset` because dictionary keys require immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set of sets: If you need a set that contains other sets, inner sets must be `frozenset` to be hashable.\n",

    "- Constants: If your application logic relies on constant sets that shouldnâ€™t be modified during runtime, `frozenset` would be the ideal choice.\n",
