    "Imagine you're working with coordinates in a three-dimensional space, where each point can be represented by three values: the x, y, and z coordinates. In Python, you can group these values into a single entity known as a tuple. This process is called packing. For instance, when you execute a statement like `point = x, y, z`, you're packing the values of x, y, and z into a tuple named `point`. This is an elegant and powerful way to create new tuple objects in Python.\n"

    "Know When to Use Packing and Unpacking:\n",
    "- Use packing when you need to group related data together logically, making the code cleaner and more organized.\n",
    "- Use unpacking when you need to access or manipulate individual elements from a sequence or a set of key-value pairs from a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain Readability:\n",
    "- Unpacking can improve readability by reducing the need for indexing; however, excessively using unpacking can make the code less readable, especially if it's not clear what each unpacked variable represents.\n",
    "- Limit the use of unpacking to scenarios where the variables being created have meaningful names that clearly indicate what data they hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Match Unpacking with Sequence Length:\n",
    "- Ensure the number of variables matches the length of the sequence when unpacking to avoid `ValueError`. If you only need a subset of the sequence, consider using extended unpacking with the `*` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Extended Unpacking Judiciously:\n",
    "- Extended unpacking is useful for capturing excess items into a list, but it can make the code unclear if overused or used with sequences of unpredictable lengths.\n",
    "- When using extended unpacking, the `*` operator should be placed on the variable that is expected to hold multiple values, which is typically the most logical place within the sequence.\n"

    "\n",
    "Modifying Sequences During Unpacking:\n",
    "- Avoid modifying a list or dictionary while it is being unpacked, as this can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overlooking Dictionary Unpacking Restrictions:\n",
    "- Remember that you cannot unpack dictionary keys directly into a list of variables as you would with tuples or lists. Instead, use the `*` operator to get the keys or the `**` operator within a context that accepts key-value pairs (like creating a new dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Misusing Underscore with Extended Unpacking:\n",
    "- The underscore `_` is often used as a throwaway variable in extended unpacking. However, it should not be used when the values are needed, as `_` is a valid variable name and using it for multiple throwaway values can lead to confusion.\n",
