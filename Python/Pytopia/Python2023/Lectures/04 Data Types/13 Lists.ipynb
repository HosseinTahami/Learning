In this list, you could have a variety of items - apples, milk, cereal, etc., all written down in one place. A List in Python is just like that shopping list. It's a collection where you can save different types of items - numbers, words, other lists, and more. Unlike a shopping list though, a Python list is saved in your computer's memory.\n",
