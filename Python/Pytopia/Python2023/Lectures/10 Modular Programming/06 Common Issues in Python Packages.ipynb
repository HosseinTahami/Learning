When a module is run directly, `__package__` is set to `None`, which is why relative imports fail.\n",

    "The `-m` flag in Python is used to run a module as a script. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose**:\n",
    "   - It tells Python to look for the named module and execute its contents as the `__main__` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syntax**:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   python -m module_name [arguments]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How it works**:\n",
    "   - Python searches for the specified module in the Python path.\n",
    "   - It then runs the module as if you had executed its contents directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Common use cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) Running built-in modules:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      python -m http.server\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      This runs Python's built-in HTTP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b) Running installed packages:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      python -m pip install package_name\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      This runs pip (Python's package installer) as a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "   c) Running your own modules:\n",
    "      If you have a module named `my_module.py`, you can run it with:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      python -m my_module\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Advantages**:\n",
    "   - It ensures that the full package is imported before the code is run.\n",
    "   - It's useful for modules that are meant to be both imported and run as scripts.\n",
    "   - It can help avoid issues with relative imports in packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Difference from direct execution**:\n",
    "   - `python script.py` runs the script directly.\n",
    "   - `python -m script` treats the script as a module, which can affect how imports work, especially for relative imports within packages.\n"
