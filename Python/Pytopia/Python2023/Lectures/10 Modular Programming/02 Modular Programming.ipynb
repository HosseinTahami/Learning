Functions encapsulate specific tasks, while classes bundle related functions and data. Modules group related functions and classes into separate files, and packages organize related modules into directories. This hierarchical structure, from functions to packages, enables developers to build complex applications with clear organization, improved maintainability, and easier testing. By leveraging these modular concepts, Python programmers can create scalable and flexible software systems efficiently."
