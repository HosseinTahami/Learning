    "Welcome to Lecture 3: Writing to Files. Writing to files is a fundamental aspect of programming that enables us to save data from our programs to persistent storage. This capability allows users to generate reports, save application state, log events, and more. Understanding how to write to files will enable you to create programs that can interact with data systems and provide output that persists beyond the life of the program itself.\n"

We'll delve into the nuances of the `write()` and `writelines()` methods, and discuss the implications of using different file opening modes, such as 'write' (`'w'`) and 'append' (`'a'`). Additionally, we'll cover best practices in file writing, including how to handle file buffering, and when to flush data to ensure it is actually written to the file system.\n"
