Similarly, in OOP, a **class** serves as a blueprint or template from which objects are created. It outlines a specific set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects based on this blueprint will possess.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class defines properties common to all objects of that type but doesn't allocate any resources or memory for itself. It specifies what an object of that class should know (attributes) and what it can do (methods) without being tied to the specifics of any one object.\n"

An object is a specific instance of a class; it embodies the structured data and behaviors defined by its class but with concrete values. Each object holds its state (data) and can perform actions (methods) defined by its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are independent entities with their characteristics. Although two objects of the same class share the class's structure and behavior, they encapsulate their own set of data. For example, if `Dog` is a class representing the concept of a dog, each `Dog` object created from that class can have its name, age, breed, etc.\n"

When an object is instantiated, it fills out the framework provided by its class with actual, specific data.\n",

    "This relationship allows for a significant degree of flexibility and reusability in programming. By defining a class once, you can create numerous objects from it, each with different attributes.
