    "1. **Method Overriding**: This occurs in the context of inheritance, where a method in a subclass has the same name, and parameters as a method in its superclass, but the implementation differs. This characteristic of polymorphism allows a subclass to customize or completely replace the behavior of a method defined in its superclass.\n",

    "2. **Duck Typing**: Python is known for its \"duck typing\" philosophy, encapsulated in the saying, \"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\" This means that the suitability of an object for a particular operation is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the object's type itself being of primary concern.

    "By running the code above, you will observe how polymorphism enables the `display_document` function to operate on any subclass of `Document` without knowing the specific type of document it's working with. Additionally, you'll see dynamic typing in action as the `current_document` changes its type from `Word` to `PDF`.
