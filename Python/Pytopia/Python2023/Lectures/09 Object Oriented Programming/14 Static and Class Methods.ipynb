    "Welcome to this lecture on Python's method types. As we dive into this topic, it's crucial to understand the backbone of Python programming - the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts that you're already familiar with, including classes, objects, methods, and the pillars of OOP such as polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. Today, we'll focus on a somewhat nuanced, yet fundamental aspect of OOP in Python - the different types of methods you can define within a class: instance methods, static methods, and class methods.\n"

    "In OOP, **methods** are functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object. They are essential for any class-based code as they help objects to interact with each other and with their environment in a structured way. Prior discussions have introduced how methods can manipulate object data, embody functionalities, and contribute to the class's overall behavior. Methods are powerful, allowing us to model real-world entities by combining them with attributes (data) inside classes.\n"

    "In Python classes, not all methods are created equal. There are three primary types you'll encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance Methods**: The most common type, these methods operate on an instance of the class (an object). They take at least one parameter: `self`, which represents the instance through which the method is called. Instance methods can access and modify the object's state since they have access to `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Static Methods**: Defined within a class, static methods are not linked to any instance. They do not take `self` or `cls` as the first argument. They are utility methods that do not access instance or class variables directly. Static methods are marked with the `@staticmethod` decorator to tell Python that they are static. We use them when a method in a class doesn't use or modify the class or its instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Class Methods**: Similar to static methods but with a twist, class methods work with the class itself rather than its instances. They take `cls` as their first parameter, allowing them to modify class state that applies across all instances. Class methods are decorated with `@classmethod`.\n"

    "- **Static methods** help organize utility functions related to a class but that don't necessarily need access to its instances or class attributes.\n",
