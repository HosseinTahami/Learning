    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows for the creation of a new class that inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class. This new class, commonly referred to as a child or subclass, can add new attributes and methods or modify existing ones inherited from the parent or base class. This mechanism promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy within the code, making it more organized and manageable.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows you to reuse the code of the base class without having to rewrite it in the subclass. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency across different parts of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintainability**: When changes are required, updating the base class automatically reflects in all subclasses, making maintenance easier and reducing the risk of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extensibility**: Inheritance makes it straightforward to extend the functionalities of existing classes. By inheriting from a base class, new classes can add distinct features or modify existing behaviors while keeping the core functionalities intact.\n",
