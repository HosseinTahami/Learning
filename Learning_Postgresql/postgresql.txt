**other databases are created from template1
  and template1 is only an empty database.

**template0 is exactly like template1 and
  only a frame for other databases but the 
  difference from template1 is you cant even
  connect to it nor change it.

|
|==> CREATE DATABASE (DB_Name) will by default 
     use template1 but if you want to choose another
     database to create your new one use TEMPLATE 
     |
     |==> CREATE DATABASE (DB_Name) TEMPLATE template0
