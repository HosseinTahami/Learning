we are on main branch and we want to merge develop branch with main !

|==> git merge develop
|
|---> After running this command if there will be a conflict in our files 
      we will see something like below !

<<<<<<<< HEAD
what is on main branch....
========
what is on develop branch....
>>>>>>>> develop

if you got confused or wanted to get back after the conflict
