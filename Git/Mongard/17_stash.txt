if you are in the middle of a task
and something happens but you can not 
commit the changes that you have made yet
|
|==> git stash || git stash save "a message you want"

After you done what you wanted and now it's time 
to complete the task that you left 
|
|==> git stash list
|
|==> git stash apply (id of your stash)

Now the things you done come back !

git stash clear
|
|==> delete all of stashes !
