.gitignore file is to mention files and directories
which you do not want git to track every time the change !

If you commit a file or directory in your repository and then you add it in the .gitignore file
it will still track the changes, so you have to remove it from the staging area(index) !
|
|==> How ? with git rm, but remember git rm will delete files from both working directory and staging area !
|           so, add a option to only remove it from your staging area !
|
|==> git rm --cached -r (file name or directory name)
|
|==> --cached is for only removing from staging area
     and -r stands for recursive when you want to remove a directory !
