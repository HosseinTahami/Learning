Git:
 The most popular version control system in the world !

Version Control System:
 Records the changes made to our code over time in a database called repository !

2 Categories of Version Control Systems:
    1. Centralized:
        All team members connect to a central server to get the latest copy of the code
        and share their changes with others ! (Subversion, Microsoft Team Foundation Server)
    2. Distributed:
        Every team member has a copy of the project with his history on their machine,
        So we can save snap shots of our project localy on our machine ! (Git, Mercurial)
