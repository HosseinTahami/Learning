Classification of Design patterns:

1. Creational Patterns: How to create an object from class !
|
|= = > provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code !

2. Structural Patterns: How can I add something to my classes and extend them !
|
|= = > Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping
the structures flexible and efficient.

3. Behavioral Patterns: How should my classes be related to each other !
|
|= = > Take care of effective communication and
the assignment of responsibilities between objects !
