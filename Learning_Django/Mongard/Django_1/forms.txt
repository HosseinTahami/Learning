create a forms.py in each app if needed!
|__ import forms from django

Exactly like creating models
Create class and use forms.Form
instead of  models.Model !

Also when using different fields put forms before
them not models 
|__ forms.CharField()

{{ form.as_p }} / {{ form.as_table }} / {{ form.as_ul }}

You can use required=  ,  label=  in the forms models
|
|___ body = forms.CharField(label='description', required=False)

from.cleaned_data()
