In our html files will have lots of repeated lines
of code so we can inherit these html files from
each other!
|
|__ Make a file name base.html and put those
    repeatable lines inside it, now to inherit 
    this file in other html files use {% extends 'base.html %}
    
Now inside the base.html create {% block <Name> %}
and close it {% endblock %} so you decide where to
put other file's code!

In the new html file where you inheritance from the base.html
use these two {% block <Name> %} {% endblock %} and put your codes
between them !

Note: There is also {% include 'file.html' %} with this you can
      show the content of a file inside another file!

When you extend a html file you can put different codes inside it and work with it
but when you include it you have the exact whole file and you cant put your codes 
inside it!
