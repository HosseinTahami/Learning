AMQP: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

publisher ---> Exchange ---> Queue ---> Consumer

Exchange Types:

1- Direct Exchange:
|
|==> Producer has a routing key which is name
     of the Queue !

2- Fanout Exchange:
|
|==> None of the queues have name and what ever Producer
     gave will go through all of the queues !

3- Topic Exchange:
|
|==> Producer has a routing key which is a pattern 
     and all the queues names are patters too so 
     the message will go through the queues that 
     match the routing key pattern.

4- Header Exchange:
|
|==> Producer will send some headers with it's message 
     and if the headers match with headers of queues the
     message go through them !
     |
     |==> inside the header of queues we have a key named x-match
          which tell us how many keys need to be matched !
